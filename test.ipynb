In the case of our model, attention patterns $A^h$ are 10 by 10 matrices that represent how each attention head $h$ moves information between the vertex positions of the input graph. For instance, if $A_{ij}^{1.3}$ is large, that means that lots of information is moved from vertex position $j$ to vertex position $i$. We say that vertex position $i$ *attends strongly* to vertex postion $j$.\n",

This means you can select an attention pattern and hover over a vertex to see which other vertices it attends to. \n",

Indeed, if we rename all the vertices of a graph but keep all the edges the same, we still want the vertices to attend to each other in the same way and so the model must adjust its attention patterns accordingly. It is therefore important to study the attnetion patterns for a whole range of input graphs. This way you can get a much better idea of what each head could be doing.\n",

This will allow us to see to what extent we can reproduce the \"clean\" behaviour of head 1.6 using a subset of the components earlier in the model. We can use this to test my theory that degree information is passed into head 1.6 via the query and the positional information pinpointing vertex position 2 is passed in via the key. We should be able to go one further and actually identify which earlier components are responsible for passing this information on to head 1.6. \n",

My best guess so far is that the model could be leveraging the fact that *vertices of degree less than 3 are not relevant to planarity*. Indeed for vertices of degree 0 or 1, removing them from a graph is never going to change a graph's planarity. For vertices of degree 2, replacing them with a single edge between their adjacent vertices is never going to change a graph’s planarity. Perhaps the purpose of head 1.6 is to help the model ignore this redundant information when making its decision? If true, it could help explain the significance of $W_{pos}W_Q^{0.2}$ representing “-2 in the degree direction”: it could be creating a “cutoff” below which all vertices should be in some sense ignored."
